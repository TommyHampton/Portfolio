He asked all the necessary questions to make sure he understood what we needed and wanted the website to look and act like. He was very creative in bring ideas to the table. When things needed tweaking, he was quick to do. Tommy was never afraid to ask questions or for guidance when he didn't know the answer. He always made sure to keep me informed about any situation that we had uncovered. He consistently made sure that I was informed about the outcomes or if I need to follow up. I truly enjoyed working with Tommy. I would not hesitate to reach out to him again for this type of work.",
