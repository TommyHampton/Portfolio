He attended my classes for both 311 and 411 JavaScript. In 311 he learned, designed and executed successfully the creation of RESTful APIs using Node, MySQL, Express and Google Cloud Platform. In 411 he created beautifully designed User Interfaces with React and Redux. Tommy worked diligently toward his goal in becoming a Full Stack JavaScript Developer. He was able to execute projects on his own and successfully collaborated with other students in contributing to a single project. Tommy sailed through the material provided and will be a great developer on any team he lands.",
